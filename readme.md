# WorkDayz
Workdayz helps to you track your tasks during project development.

*Note:* this is highly unstable app  in order to get it working, you might have to press the refresh button a few times (not the browser refresh button - not present on login and registration), go back and forth between pages (projects)

Features implemented
- Client side (quite buggy)
- Server side (slightly stable)
- Route guards (on both ends)
- Client-side store to prevent redundant requests
- Server side stateless authentication & authorization
